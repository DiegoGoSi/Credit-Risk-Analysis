# Risk Prediction Analysis

## Description
This project aims to analyze the risk of default for loan applicants using a dataset of historical loan applications. The dataset includes various features such as credit score, income, loan amount, and employment history. We explore the data and build several machine learning models to predict the risk of default for new loan applicants.

## Requirements
